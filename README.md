# Origami-Analyst
Origami analyst is a Framework tool, which provides predictive structural data on a protein based off Mass Spectrometry and Ion mobility data provided by the user.
It is still a work in progress and my first project to upload to github, it was set as project by my supervisor for my PhD.
I am a first year PhD student and I am very new to programming.
