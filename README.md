# Origami-Analyst
Origami analyst is a Framework tool, which provides predictive structural data on a protein based off Mass Spectrometry and Ion mobility data provided by the user.
It is still a work in progress and my first project to upload to github, it was set as project by my supervisor for my PhD.
I am a first year PhD student and I am very new to programming.


So far I have completed a GUI for the Collision Cross Section Boundary calculation. How this GUI works is very simple:

1. first you simply import a <filename>.txt of your amino acid sequence, it must be single letter code in upper case.

2. Second click calculate and the program will carry out the calculation to give you your CCSB and output the answers below.
